# Insights
  <img width="1114" alt="Screenshot 2024-09-04 at 2 07 55â€¯pm" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c743055e-6d9f-47a8-aeb9-04241a26993a">
  
  Verification Status by Amount: Over 53.92% of the loan amount has been verified, suggesting a strong adherence to verification protocols. However, a significant portion remains unverified, which may present risks.
  
  Loan Purpose Distribution: Debt consolidation dominates at 50.27%, indicating a trend where customers are primarily seeking to manage existing debt rather than new investments or purchases.
  

  Customers by Homeownership: A larger portion of customers (50%) are renting rather than owning homes, which might correlate with the high demand for debt consolidation loans.
  
  Year-wise Loan and Recovery Trends: There's a peak in loan disbursements and recovery around the early 2000s, followed by a decline. This could indicate economic shifts or changing bank policies.
  
  Customers by Grade: Most customers fall within the A and B grades, indicating good creditworthiness, but there are still a number of lower-grade customers, which could be a focus area for risk management.

# Recommendations 
  Targeted Marketing for Homeowners: Consider developing specialized loan products or incentives for homeowners, as they represent a smaller but potentially more stable customer base.
  
  Enhance Verification Processes: To mitigate risks, focus on increasing the verification rate for loan amounts, especially targeting the unverified segment.
